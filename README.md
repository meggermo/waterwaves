Water waves
-----------
Boundary elements method for simulation of non-linear water waves.

Build instructions:
```
  autoreconf --install && ./configure && make
```
This builds the binaries src/waterwaves and src/splinetest.
I did not have the time to write documentation yet, so finding
out how to use this software will be quite daunting :).
